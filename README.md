## Requirements

+ Arduino
+ Arduino IDE or any other arduino compatible IDE
+ DHT library of arduino
+ DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
+ Ultrasonic Distance sensor
+ Buzzer for alarm

## How to Run

Simple Steps to build the project:
  1. Wire the data pins of **DHT-11** to digital pin **10**
  2. Wire the **echo** pin of ultrasonic sound sensor to the digital pin **6**.
  3. Wire the **trigger** pin of ultrasonic sound sensor to the digital pin **4**.
  4. To install the **DHT library**, use the **Arduino Library Manager** and search for **"DHT sensor library"** and install the library.
  5. Open the **[HeatStroke_prevention.ino](https://github.com/OddExtension5/Vehicular_heatstroke_prevention_system/blob/master/HeatStroke_prevention.ino)** file in the Arduino IDE and upload to the board using appropriate settings.

Have fun!
